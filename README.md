# Data


The data set is a multivariate, time-series containing 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an
Air Quality Chemical Multi-sensor device. This air quality data set provided through the University of California, [Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+quality#) represents the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses. There are 13 attributes in the data set which potentially can be used as predictors with two outcome variables - Relative Humidity (RH) and Absolute Humidity (AH). 


# Analysis

To explore the relationship between the predictors and the outcome variables of this data set, we employ techniques such as:
* Comparison Multivariate Regression and PC Regression
* Stimulation study on the distribution of the residuals
* Factor Analysis on the predictors (comparison PC method and ML method)
* Time Dependent Analysis (exploring how the relationship between outcomes and predictors with change in Month and Hour)
